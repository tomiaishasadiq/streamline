# Streamline

Streamline is a React app that shows upcoming TV shows from different streaming services and TV networks. It helps users find both new and returning shows in one place, without having to search through multiple platforms.

Created using React JS, Tailwindcss and TMDB API.

## How to start the app after forking or cloning the repo:

1. Navigate to the project directory: cd streamline
2. npm install
3. npm run start

### Reasons for Streamline:

1. **Rising Costs of Streaming Services**  
With streaming services getting more expensive, it's difficult to afford multiple subscriptions at once. Switching between services can also be difficult because many platforms only let you see upcoming shows if you're already a subscriber. Streamline helps by showing upcoming shows across different services, so you can easily decide which one to subscribe to next.

2. **Discover new/returning content easily**  
Finding new or returning shows often means browsing through different social media platforms. Streamline puts everything in one place, so you can quickly see whatâ€™s coming without wasting time searching around.
